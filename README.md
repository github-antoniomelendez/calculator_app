# Overview

As a software engineer I want to have the ability to learn new programming languages through practice and software development. I want to be able to accomplish tasks and develop funcionality in a variety of programming languages. The purpose of this software is for me to practice using the Rust programming language and to develop clean, efficient, and working code. Sotware engineers always need to stay up to date with the many new technologies at their disposal. Having the ability to adapt to new technologies will help me be a better and more efficient software engineer.
My software uses Rust as a programming language to develop a basic calculator and a factorial calculator. I added a simple menu where the user can choose which calculator to use. Once chosen, the user interacts with the software to provide valid integers (numbers). These values are then calculated and the program provides a result. 
I decided to use modularization in the program to organize my code in different files, then bring them into scope using the use keyword in my main file. I believe this approach improves the readability of my code and it helps with debugging, and fixing future errors. 
While working on this software, I had the oportunity to learn about the syntax used in Rust, I created variables, functions, methods, impl blocks. I used input handling, recursion, ownership and error handlling. Everything helped me learn the basics of Rust and create a basic and factorial calculator. 
To run the program I use cd calculator_app and cargo run.

# Development Environment



I used the Rust programming language to develop this software. I also used Cargo, this is a code compiler, it runs 
the project and manages dependencies.
I used Vs Code, this is a code editor, used for writing, editing and organizing my code into different files. I installed some extensions like Rust Analyzer and CodeLLDB, the first provides hint and help when writng the code, the second is used for debugging Rust programs. 
I used the terminal which is a command line interface to interact with the software during execution and to run the Cargo commands. 

I used Rust programming language to build this software, Rust uses moden syntax features like ownership, borrowing 
and pattern matching, all these were used to build this software. Rust also has error handling and is considered
fast and memmory-efficient. 
I used Rust's standard library to develop this software. I used std::io for input and output operations.
I also used String, match, Option and Result. These all helped with the logic and functionality of my program.
No external libraries were used to develop this software.
Modularization tools were used to organize the code into different files. I brought the structs into scope with the use keyword in my main file.

# Future Work

- Item 1 - I would like to add more operators and math functions to my calculators.
- Item 2 - I would like to implent a better looking main menu and improve it with more options.
- Item 3 - I would like to add tests to my program.
